# Welcome

This course is an introduction to numerical analysis. The name tells you a bit about the purpose of the course. The 'analysis' part tells you that it belongs to the sequence of calculus courses; this is because we will study problems involving real numbers. The 'numerical' part reflects that the course is about computational methods. In short, the course is largely about solving problems based in calculus. Computational problems in linear algebra are an important part of numerical analysis as well, sometimes because the computations involve real numbers, and sometimes because of special considerations for linear algebra algorithms that are relevant for computations but are not particularly relevant in many mathematics classes.

What are the major problems of numerical analysis? Representing numbers. Root finding. Differentiation. Integration. Solving ordinary and partial differential equations. Approximating functions. Solving linear systems, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Efficient multiplication of large numbers and convolutions.

We will explore these topics during the course.

## Style and goals

This course is quite different in style from most mathematics or computer science courses. The course combines elements of a mathematics course (with definitions and theorems) and a computing course (with discussions of running time, programming techniques.) The course is intended to be both an introduction to the topic of numerical analysis and a practical course emphasizing skills development to enable you to solve numerical problems in other courses and your own independent work. 

The course is only an introduction to a large area, so a key learning goal will be to help you develop skills for learning new ideas and methods from numerical analysis on your own. 

## Evaluation

Learning quizzes: One for each major topic. Can be retaken until material is mastered. No due dates. 10% total.
Homework: 7 (approximately one every 2 weeks). 10% each. No late assignments, but your lowest grade will be dropped.
Final project: Due during the exam period. 30%.
